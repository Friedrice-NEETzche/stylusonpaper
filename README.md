# Introduction
One-stop hub for all your CS Resources.
Roadmaps and references provided for each standard resource.
Why the name Stylus on Paper? Cause CS Repository sounds conventional.

### MUST READ FOR NAVIGATION

â–  The emoji ðŸŽ“ indicates the most preferred option incase you're confused as to what to choose. The standard resource followed by many. All others can be used for reference.

â–  **DO NOT FALL INTO TUTORIAL HELL**
As soon as you complete any lecture or section, immediately go and apply it by solving assignments, problem sets, or projects. Do not keep watching lectures for eternity, because in the end, you won't be able to recall anything.

â–  **DO NOT GET OVERWHELMED BY THE RESOURCES PROVIDED**
Which is why if you're a beginner, I'll recommend you to follow [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#open-source-society-university).  A curriculum along with deadlines will be provided to you with all the required resources, so that you need not worry about your choice of resource.
**However, if you have a set plan**, maybe to learn Data Science, Machine Learning or Computer Programming, then skip to that particular section via [Contents](#Contents). 

â–  **Focus on one particular discipline, and move on to the next only after its completion.**
Do not think about the others. One step at a time. A note for beginners.


# Computer-Science
The study of computation, automation and information. 
Not to be confused with computer programming.
These resources provide a set curriculum and resources for you, if you're puzzled to take one on your own. Equivalent to online college courses, except that you won't get any certificate.

1. ðŸŽ“[Open Source Society University [OSSU]](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#open-source-society-university)
The most popular and detailed one, contains resources and deadlines for every topic and its pre-requisite. A really well organized curriculum, perfect to cover your CS theory to a good depth.

**Other sources which you may refer to:** 
1. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
Has a curriculum which you can follow, along with tons of project ideas for each language. 
A very great source to learn frameworks and languages not available in OSSU.

2. [Self Learning Modern CS](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/)
Covers the math and theoretical concepts of CS. You can refer it incase you're stuck somewhere in OSSU. 
Resources are provided (Lectures + recommended books) for each topic.

3. [Teach yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
Less clutter & little less detailed than OSSU. Nevertheless, it's perfect if you want to learn one particular topic from scratch. Very well written guide, with lectures and recommended books provided for every topic.

**Optional Miscellaneous courses for reference**
1. [Harvard's CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/)
Beginner level at best. Go for it if you're just starting out and the above curriculums overwhelm you.

 
# Math
- For computer programming - **high school algebra & calculus** is enough to a large extent.
- For competitive programming - **algebra** is a pre-requisite, and **discrete math** aids in your skills albeit optional.
- For data science - **statistics, linear algebra, probability and calculus** are pre-requisites.
- However, if you're pursuing computer science, AI/ML, then you may need to delve deeper into **higher level math**.

Note: 
1. **If you're following OSSU's curriculum, you need not follow this section.** 
2. For people who are willing to take a particular course but are lacking the math skills required for it.

### High school Math
**High school math is a pre-requisite for every computer discipline and math courses other than computer programming. 
It is optional in the latter and is useful in few projects that may require it.**

For high school math (If you're starting from SCRATCH):

# Computer-Programming
Languages, so it is.

OSSU doesn't dive much deep into different programming languages and frameworks, so even if you follow OSSU, you have to refer to the below given guides for learning them.

You can get started in this with basic understanding of math. 
There are already extensive resource guides written on this topic, which is why I'll just link them down below.

[Curated Resources + Getting started guide](https://github.com/Michael0x2a/curated-programming-resources/blob/master/resources.md)
[List of project based tutorials for practical learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning)

[Theoretical concepts of Programming](http://nsm.iitm.ac.in/cse/#all-services)
Covers only the theoretical portion of programming and computer design, refer to it if you're stuck in any concept while following OSSU/your own college.

Too many questions/doubts about the journey?

# Data-Science
Math heavy discipline.

Data science has some overlap with Machine Learning concepts.
Both are not the same, and neither of them is a subset/superset of the other.

An important distinction: 
Data analytics comes under Data Science.
Data science consists of Data Analytics, Data Mining, Machine Learning and a few other related disciplines.

**Included in OSSU, however if you're looking to particularly excel in Data Science, then refer to the resources below.**

1. ðŸŽ“[Google Data Analytics Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)
0 Pre-requisites. You can pursue it without any prior math or coding experience.

2. ðŸŽ“[John Hopkins Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
A complete guide through Data Science. However, you may get lost as to what you're learning and what awaits you, so refer to the course forum if you face any such issues. There are posts to help you out.

3. [ONLY MATH] **IITM Data Science Math Lectures**
[Mathematics for Data Science I](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2ps__7DhBZYDZo9A0pZ_i0xhstrk5cR)
[Mathematics for Data Science II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2ps__7DhBboGlwPVSsWP8loAJCLrKc8)
[Statistics for Data Science I](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2ps__7DhBYrMs3zybOqr1DzMFCX49xG)
[Statistics for Data Science II](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2ps__7DhBbLZ6RdNTIXvFdaMpvqagt0)
Covers all the math and beyond. **Very extensive.**
There are problem solving lectures, however there are no assignments or other resources available.
Referring a book is necessary.
